## First Verse 
 

 "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"  

He took his vorpal sword in hand:  
  Long time the manxome foe he sought --  
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,  
  And stood awhile in thought.  
 
  ## Second Verse
 

 Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

Then took the other, as just as fair,  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  
Had worn them really about the same,
